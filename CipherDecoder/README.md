##### This was developed to help understand how ciphers work.

What are you talking about? [Learn more about cryptography first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFZGF8FHSg).

I used [**_Caesar Cipher_**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/caesar-cipher) here. 


Files included:

-    Automation - Runs on M2 to evaluate all possible shifts to decode the cipher
-    M2 - Engine that is responsible for decoding and encoding ceasar cipher.

\
*Note: M2 can run on its own. However, if you separate m2 from Automation, you will run into problems as it is dependent on the decode/encode engine.*
